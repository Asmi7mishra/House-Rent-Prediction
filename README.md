# House-Rent-Prediction
House Rent prediction helps to predict the rent price of house, varying due to depending factors.


In this project, initial step is to download or access a valid dataset which can provide the quantity and quality of data. The dataset has been attached by the name "data.csv". 
Next step includes checking for python libraries which are primarily used for working on ML models.
The may include -pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.

For model selection, i prefered Linear Regression due to presence of contiguous variables.
-from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
To finally check the accuracy of our model we need to import mean_squared_error, r2_score, accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics.
